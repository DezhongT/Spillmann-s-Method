# An attempt to replace MATLAB's parfor by python's parallel processing
# nProcesses is the number of processes that should be run simultaneously
# A list of system commands to be run are written in Commands.txt

# Don't use a command like 'cmd &> output' -> the process won't wait to finish in that case

# Updated: 07/24/2013

# Updated: 08/18/2013
# Usage: python RunBASim3.py [optional_filename]
# filename should have a list of commands one in each line
